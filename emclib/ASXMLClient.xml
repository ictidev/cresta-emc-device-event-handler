             Binding with the <see cref="T:AgileSoftware.Developer.ASXMLClient"/> component, XML Station is used to 
             perform the telephony operations on a voice station and manage the calls associated with it.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             Binding with the <see cref="T:AgileSoftware.Developer.ASXMLClient"/> component, XML Station monitors the 
             voice station specified by the <see cref="P:AgileSoftware.Developer.ASXMLStation.StationDN"/> property. 
             Comparing with the <see cref="T:AgileSoftware.Developer.ASXMLClient"/>, it provides the objects on a layer 
             higher than the XML and CSTAT tier. The objects exposed by ASXMLStation preserve the active calls on 
             the voice station and allow users to manipulate calls through a set of methods at the call 
             appearance level.<br></br><br></br>
             <p><b>Thread Safety:</b></p>
             Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.<br></br><br></br>
             If any instance member is invoked from a thread that is different from the one  
             the <see cref="E:AgileSoftware.Developer.ASXMLClient.XMLResponseReturned"/> event of the 
             underlying XMLClient fires, synchronization is required to provide thread safe operation. 
             For instance, if the CallDial method is invoked from a separate thread, the following synchronization 
             lock needs to add to the code block:<br></br><br></br>
             //For C#:<br></br>
             lock(asxmlStation1) asxmlStation1.CallDial("8576", "");<br></br><br></br>

            ASXMLClient is the client component for communicating with the Active XML Server.
            </summary>
            <remarks>The XML Client works as the client-side component to communicate with the Active XML Server.
            It allows users to perform telephony operations through the services and events defined in 
            "XML Protocol for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA) Phase III" (Standard ECMA-323)
            by exposing two tiers of functionalities: XML tier and CSTA tier.
            <br></br><br></br>
            You can use its exposed members to implement telephony operations directly, or, in a simpler way, 
            treat it as a "data source" of the <see cref="T:AgileSoftware.Developer.ASXMLStation"/>, <see cref="T:AgileSoftware.Developer.ASXMLRouting"/> 
            and <see cref="T:AgileSoftware.Developer.ASXMLVDN"/> components to achieve the same purposes by binding those 
            higher level components to the XMLClient. It is suggested that you use the second approach if possible, especially when building a 
            soft-phone application to control desktop voice stations.<br></br><br></br>
            <p><b>Thread Safety:</b></p>
            Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.<br></br><br></br>
            <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
            Please make sure to invoke the ASXMLClient <b>Dispose</b> when an application using it needs to be closed. Failing doing that may cause the

            Initiates event reports for a call, device, or for one or more
            calls involving a device.<br></br><br></br>
            The server starts a monitor, allocates a Monitor Cross Reference Identifier that uniquely identifies the monitor, and
            then positively acknowledges the request. All activities satisfying the filter provided (for example: call, feature,
            agent, private) trigger events which are delivered as a stream of event reports to the server. Each event contains the
            Monitor Cross Reference Identifier that correlates the event back to the Monitor Start service that established the monitor.<br></br><br></br>
            These event reports cease after the monitor is terminated by the server or invoking the CSTAMonitorStop method. Once the monitor 
            is terminated, the monitor cross reference ID is no longer valid.<br></br><br></br>
            Two types of monitor can be placed on a monitor object: Call-type and Device-type.<br></br><br></br>
            Call-type: The call continues to be monitored as long as it remains in the switching sub-domain.<br></br><br></br>
            For example, if a call that is being call-type monitored is transferred to another device in 
            the switching sub-domain, the call will continue to be monitored. The application receives events for all
            devices in the call until the call ceases to exist or until it leaves the switching sub-domain. The Diverted
            event is an exception. The switching function (as indicated through the capabilities exchange services)
            may or may not be providing Diverted events to all devices in a call.<br></br><br></br>
            For call-type monitors:<br></br><br></br>
            When a device ceases to participate in a call, and the call is transferred or forwarded to another
            device, subsequent events at the new device are reported. The Monitor Cross Reference Identifier
            used in events at the new device will be the same one used before the call was forwarded or transferred.<br></br><br></br>
            If a call is being monitored using a call-type monitor and one of the devices consults to another
            device (i.e. a new call is created), then the computing function will not see events for the
            secondary call (new consultation call) until either the primary call is transferred to the consulted
            device, or until the two calls are conferenced together.<br></br><br></br>
            A call that is being monitored may have a new Call Identifier assigned to it after a conference or
            transfer. The call related events report the new Call Identifier in a Conferenced or Transferred
            event.<br></br><br></br>
            Device-type: The call does not continue to be monitored after the call leaves the device.<br></br><br></br>

            1. The Alternate Call service shall not be used to put an alerting call on hold and re-connect to another call that is 
            on hold.<br></br><br></br>
            2. This service is a multiple step service that is equivalent to the computing function issuing the Hold Call 
            service for the activeCall ConnectionID and then issuing one of the following services:<br></br><br></br>
            a. a Retrieve Call service for the heldCall ConnectionID.<br></br><br></br>
            b. an Answer Call service for the heldCall ConnectionID.<br></br><br></br>
            c. an Accept Call service for the heldCall ConnectionID.<br></br><br></br>
            3. The consultOptions parameter indicates the potential action following the Alternate Call service so that certain 
            facilities can be allocated if a transfer or conference is desired. If the switching function supports the 
            consultOptions parameter, the computing function shall provide one of the supported values of this parameter 
            obtained through the capability exchange services. If the switching function requires preallocation of 
            resources to support transfer or conference but is unable to allocate the resources required to support the 
            indicated usage at this time, it shall reject the Alternate Call service request. This parameter does not indicate 
            a restriction or otherwise affect the switching function's capabilities in any way with respect to services other 
            than Transfer or Conference.<br></br><br></br>
            4. If all appearances of a shared bridged device configuration are in the hold state and the heldCall parameter 
            contains an appearance's connection ID in the call, then the other appearances in the device configuration will

            1. A connection may transition to the Failed state prior to Null if the device stays off-hook and receives busy or 
            blocked tone. The time between the state transition of Failed --&gt; Null is device and switching function specific 
            and the time may be substantial. Note that the service is completed when all connections transit to either the 
            Null or the Failed state.<br></br><br></br>

            1. For device-type monitors, it is always guaranteed that the Connection Cleared event associated with the 
            monitored device is provided, and that this is the last Connection Cleared event for the cleared call over the 
            monitor. Depending on how the switching function processes the service request, Connection Cleared events 
            for the other devices in the call may precede this last Connection Cleared event.<br></br><br></br>
            2. The exact sequence of the Connection Cleared events for this service is not specified. This is due to the fact 
            that when multiple devices are removed from a call as a result of the service, each switching function may 
            process the clearing of those devices in a different order. <br></br><br></br>
            3. If a device stays off-hook and receives busy or blocked tone, the switching function sends the Failed event 
            (event cause of Blocked or Busy) to indicate the status of the device, followed by a Connection Cleared event. 
            The time between the generation of the Failed event and the Connection Cleared event is device and switching 
            function specific and the time may be substantial. As for generation of the Failed event for a given monitor 
            and device in the call, it follows the same conditions as the Connection Cleared events (if the event is 
            supported by the switching function): No events reporting connection transitions for other devices in the call 
            will be sent. However, the Connection Cleared event for the given monitor will be sent (and will be the last 
            event associated with the cleared call sent over that monitor) when the connection transits to Null.<br></br><br></br>
            <p><b>Functional Requirements:</b></p>
            1. The Clear Call service shall only affect the callToBeCleared ConnectionID's call. Other calls that exist at the 
            callToBeCleared ConnectionID's device remain unaffected.<br></br><br></br>
            2. The connection ID provided in the request may consist of only a callID portion. This is an exception to the 
            rule of not providing deviceIDs in connectionIDs of service requests.

            parameter is switching function dependent.<br></br><br></br>
            4. Call Forwarding and Do Not Disturb features for the calling device are not honoured for the call being made. 
            If a switching function supports prompting of the calling device and detects that a feature was activated while 
            processing the Make Call service and this feature cannot be overridden, then the switching function will return 
            a negative acknowledgement.<br></br><br></br>
            5. All active features are honoured for the called device.<br></br><br></br>
            6. If a Make Call service is issued for a calling device that has a connection in the Initiated state (i.e., the 
            computing function got a Service Initiated event for a phone manually going off-hook), and the switching 
            function can support the issuing of the Make Call service under this condition, then the Connection ID in the 
            positive acknowledgement of the Make Call service will contain the same Connection ID received on the 
            Service Initiated event. If the switching function does not support the Make Call service under this condition, 
            then the service will be rejected with a negative acknowledgement.<br></br><br></br>
            7. The calledDirectoryNumber parameter may contain a device identifier of null (a null formatted device 
            identifier) or contain a Diallable Digits format (DD) device identifier that has a partial dialling sequence 
            character (i.e., the ";" character) at the end of it. When this parameter is used in this manner, the computing 
            function is indicating that it wishes to stage the dialling sequence. The completion of the dialling sequence can 
            be accomplished either by entering the rest of the sequence manually at the actual device or the computing 
            function can use the Dial Digits service to complete the sequence. The other types of calledDirectoryNumber 
            parameter shall contain a complete dialling sequence. The switching function may have a timeout period for 
            multi-stage dialling. If the dialling sequence does not complete prior to this timeout, it may either abort the 
            call or attempt to use the digits already dialled and signal that dialling is complete with an originated event.<br></br><br></br>
            8. If the Make Call service is used to initiate a multistage dialling sequence, the computing function is signalled 
            to continue the dialling sequence via either the Service Initiated event (i.e., if the calledDirectoryNumber is 
            Null) or the Digits Dialled event (i.e., if the calledDirectoryNumber has a partial dialling sequence character). <br></br><br></br>
            9. When prompting a device which has a call appearance, bridged, or hybrid device configuration, only one of 
            the appearances will be delivered the call.<br></br><br></br>
            10. The callingDevice parameter in the Make Call service request may represent a group of devices from which 
            the actual calling device is selected. In this case, the callingDevice parameter in subsequent events shall refer 
            to the actual calling device. In addition, the Originated event contains a parameter (originatingDevice) that 
            represents the group of devices (the callingDevice parameter passed in service request).<br></br><br></br>

            progress associated with the connection to the transferredTo device.<br></br><br></br>
            2. A Connection Cleared Event will not be provided for the activeCall or heldCall ConnectionIDs. The 
            Transferred event implies connection cleared for the transferring device.<br></br><br></br>
            3. If the transferring device stays off-hook and receives busy or blocked tone, the switching function may send a 
            Failed event (event cause of Blocked or Busy) for a different call, followed by a Connection Cleared event.<br></br><br></br>

            This sample completes a consultation transfer on device 8576. The two calls envolved in the transfer operation are a held call 
            (CallId=56) and a active call (CallID=59).

            1. The switching function may have a time-out period for the call once it is held. If the call is not retrieved 
            before the time-out period ends, then the held call may ringback either the holding device or a device 
            predefined by the switching function (such as an attendant console, for example).<br></br><br></br>
            2. For Shared Bridged device configurations, when a call is held by an appearance (callToBeHeld) all 
            appearances will transition to the hold state (i.e., Held events with a cause of Normal), except when the call 
            that is being held is part of an Independent Shared Bridged device configuration and the appearance that is 
            holding the call is not the last appearance connected into the call. In this case only the appearance holding the 
            call will transition to the hold state and the other appearances are unaffected. For more information, refer to 
            Annex A.2.3, "Shared-Bridged" of "Services for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA) Phase III" (Standard ECMA-269). <br></br><br></br>
            3. As a result of placing a connection associated with a digital data call (if supported by the switching function) 
            on hold, the other calls at the device or device configuration are unrelated with this call.<br></br>

            1. The call ID in the ConnectionIDs for the resulting conference call is the same as that in the original active call. <br></br><br></br>
            2. It is switching function dependent to determine at which point in the call progress a device is actually 
            conferenced into a call. For example, a device may become part of an existing call before it is actually 
            conferenced into a call. In this case, additional events may flow before the Conferenced event. The callID in 
            the ConnectionIDs for these events shall be the same as that in the original active call and shall be the same as 
            in the Conferenced event that follows.<br></br><br></br>
            3. The appearances in a shared bridged device configuration are unaffected by this service.<br></br><br></br>
            4. This service request does not support the use of a null device identifier or a Diallable Digits format (DD) 
            device identifier that has a partial dialling sequence character (i.e., the ";" character) in it for the deviceToJoin 
            parameter. A complete and valid device identifier shall be provided, otherwise the switching function will 
            reject the service request with a negative acknowledgement.<br></br><br></br>

            <img src="../CSTASingleStepTransferCall1.gif" name=""/><br></br><br></br>
            1. If the transferredTo device is not in the connected state after the Single Step Transfer Call service is executed, 
            then normal call progress events will flow regarding the state of this device after the Transferred event.<br></br><br></br>
            2. A Connection Cleared event will not be seen for the activeCall ConnectionID; the Transferred event implies 
            that the connection at the transferringDevice has been cleared.<br></br><br></br>
            3. If the transferring device stays off-hook and receives busy or blocked tone, the switching function sends a 
            Failed event (event cause of Blocked or Busy) for a call with a different callID (not C1 or C3), followed by a 
            Connection Cleared event.<br></br><br></br>
            4. Providing of these events by the switching function does not affect the service completion conditions (i.e., a 
            service is considered complete without these events being provided).<br></br><br></br>
            
            <p><b>Functional Requirements:</b></p>
            1. The application should never assume the reuse of callIDs, although some switching functions may reuse the activeCall callID for the transferredCall callID.<br></br><br></br>
            2. As a result of this service, the device or devices being transferred may hear call-progress signals for the new 
            device. For example, if the new device answers, the call resumes or if the new device is busy or does not 
            answer, the other devices in the call may receive resulting call progress tones. In either case, the transferring 
            device has left the call and has no further relationship with it.<br></br><br></br>
            3. If the Single Step Transfer Call service fails for any reason after the positive acknowledgement is returned, the 
            switching function may return the call to the transferring device. Refer to 6.8.3, "Recall" of "Services for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA) Phase III" (Standard ECMA-269).<br></br><br></br>
            4. For the new destination device (transferredTo device), all active features for the device are honoured.<br></br><br></br>
            5. This service request does not support the use of a null device identifier or a Diallable Digits format (DD) 
            device identifier that has a partial dialling sequence character (i.e., the ";" character) in it for the transferredTo

            reject the service request with a negative acknowledgement.<br></br><br></br>
            6. If this service is used to single step transfer a digital data call, the connection for the transferredTo device (i.e., 
            transferredCall) will inherit the characteristics of the call.

            2. For the newDestination, all active features for this device will be honoured while the call is being deflected to

            2. This service can not be used to generate DTMF tones on an existing connected call. The Generate Digits

            outbound dialling).<br></br><br></br>
            3. If no digits have been dialled for the diallingConnection through the original Make Call service or a previous 
            Dial Digits service, the diallingSequence parameter can be any format of device identifier. Otherwise the 
            diallingSequence parameter shall be in Diallable Digits format.<br></br><br></br>
            4. If the diallingSequence parameter is intended to provide just a portion of a longer dialling sequence to follow, 
            then it shall be in Diallable Digits format with the last character of the sequence being ";". Otherwise the 
            diallingSequence parameter will be interpreted as the last in the dialling sequence for the diallingConnection.<br></br><br></br>
            5. The premature termination of a dialling sequence can be done by either using the Clear Connection service, 
            Clear Call service, or having the dialling connection manually cleared.<br></br><br></br>
            6. The switching function may have a time-out period for multi-stage dialling. If the dialling sequence does not 
            complete prior to this timeout, it may either abort the call or attempt to use the digits already dialled and signal 
            that dialling is complete with an originated event.<br></br><br></br>
            7. If the switching function determines that dialling is complete even if a ";" was supplied, it will originate the

            1. The completion criteria for this service depends upon the signallingCondition component specified in the service request:<br></br><br></br>
            a. the Delivered or Established event (whichever flows first) for D2 if the signallingCondition is Delivered<br></br><br></br>
            b. the Established event for D2 if the signallingCondition is Established<br></br><br></br>
            In the case where the switching function detects that the conditions specified in the signallingCondition 
            component cannot be met (for example when the call fails or queues at the called device), the service is
            completed when the switching function generates the event corresponding to the condition at the called
            device that prevented the signallingCondition from being met (Failed, Queued events, for example) or
            Connection Cleared if the switching function cleared the called connection (see Functional Requirement #4).<br></br><br></br>
            2. If the signallingConditionAction parameter specifies remainConnected, then depending on the type of calling 
            device and its state, the Delivered, Queued, Failed, and Established events can flow for D1. These events are
            not part of the service completion criteria.<br></br><br></br>
            3. In the case where the switching function reserves the calling device for allocating the predictive call to it,
            Functional Requirement #10 applies but the cause code of reserved shall be used.<br></br><br></br>
            <p><b>Functional Requirements:</b></p>
            1. The service does not guarantee the connection to the calling device; only that an attempt will be made to
            connect to the device.<br></br><br></br>
            2. The calling device in a Make Predictive Call service request is often a group or ACD device that then
            allocates the new call to another calling device.<br></br><br></br>
            3. A typical use of the Make Predictive Call service is to place calls outside the CSTA switching sub-domain.
            The CSTA connection identifier reported in the positive acknowledgement refers to the Network Interface
            Device associated with the called device.<br></br><br></br>
            4. The parameter defaultAction is used in situations where the switching function detects that the
            signallingCondition in the service request cannot be met. For example, the requestor of the service has the
            capability to instruct the switching function to either connect the calling device for listening to the voice
            channel or to clear the call.<br></br><br></br>
            5. If the validation of the Make Predictive Call fails initial for any reason, the computing function receives a
            negative acknowledgement, and no valid ConnectionIDs will have been created.<br></br><br></br>
            6. Multi-stage dialling is not supported for the Make Predictive Call service.<br></br><br></br>
            7. The switching function may indicate that the calling device is involved with a predictive call prior to any call
            activity at the calling device by generating a Service Initiated event (with a cause of Make Predictive Call) for
            the calling device. When the Service Initiated event is generated in this case, it is generated prior to any call
            control events at the called device. If the switching function does not generate the Service Initiated event in
            this case, no call control events will be generated for the calling device until after the calling device is joined
            into the call. If the calling device cannot be joined in the call, a Connection Cleared event is generated for the
            initiatedConnection.<br></br><br></br>

            1. This service is used for end-to-end signalling purposes. This service shall not be used to perform dialling 
            sequences (the Dial Digits service shall be used to perform this function).<br></br><br></br>
            2. The charactersToSend parameter may contain additional non-standardised characters. Handling of the 
            additional characters is switching function dependent.<br></br><br></br>
            3. If the toneDuration or pauseDuration parameters in the service request are not present or if they are present but 
            cannot be satisfied, the switching function may use its default value.<br></br><br></br>
            4. A Generate Digits service request may be rejected if there is already a switching function generated tone 
            (busy, music, ringback, etc.) on the call.<br></br><br></br>
            5. If a Generate Digits service request is received by the switching function while a previous Generate Digits 
            service request has not yet been completed, the new request may or may not be rejected but in any case the 
            digits shall not be interleaved or overlaid.

             <remarks>
             In the case where an ACD agent is 
            	involved with an ACD call, the transition to the requested state may or may not occur until the current connection 
            	transitions to the null state.<br></br><br></br>
             An agent represents a device's association and activities with one or more ACD devices or ACD groups.<br></br><br></br>
             <p><b>Agent Log On Models:</b></p>
             An agent becomes associated with a specific ACD device or ACD group by the process of logging on. There are 
            	two Agent Log On Models that may be supported by a switching function. Note that multiple models 
            	may be supported by a switching function and by a single agent.<br></br><br></br>
            	Log On to an ACD device - In this model an agent logs on to ACD device and becomes associated with the 
            	activities of the ACD device. There is no association with any ACD group. This may be achieved by using the 
            	Set Agent State service (loggedOn) without providing the ACD group parameter. Note that this capability 
            	cannot be simultaneously supported with the Log On to an ACD Group (implicit/one step) described below.<br></br><br></br>
            	Log On to an ACD Group - In this model an agent becomes associated with the activities of an ACD group. 
            	This may be accomplished by the following:<br></br><br></br>
            	1. explicit/one step - by using the Set Agent State (loggedOn) service and supplying the ACD group parameter<br></br><br></br>
            	2. explicit/two step - by first logging on to an ACD device using the Set Agent State (loggedOn) service and 
            	omitting the ACD group parameter (described above). Once logged on to an ACD device, a log on to a 
            	specific group is achieved by using another Set Agent State (loggedOn) service with the ACD group 
            	parameter provided.<br></br><br></br>
            	3. implicit/one step - by logging on to an ACD Group using the Set Agent State (loggedOn) service and 
            	omitting the ACD group parameter. If supported by the switching function, the agent is automatically 
            	logged on to an ACD group. Note that this capability cannot be simultaneously supported with the Log 
            	On to an ACD device.<br></br><br></br>
            	<p><b>Agent Identifier:</b></p>
            	Each agent that can be observed and/or controlled within the switching function is referenced using an assigned 
            	identifier. This identifier is associated with the logical element's Device Identifier of the device. Certain switching 
            	functions may not assign an agent identifier to the agent. In these cases, the logical element's Device Identifier is 
            	used to represent the agent associated with the device. The format of the agent identifier is switching function 
            	specific.<br></br> <br></br>
            	There are two ways that an agent identifier may be provided:<br></br><br></br>
            	as a parameter in an event (via the agentID parameter in the Agent Logged Off event, for example) or<br></br><br></br>
            	as a sub-string in the Switching Function Representation format of a logical element's Device Identifier, 
            	thereby making a unique identifier for the logical element and the associated agent.<br></br> <br></br>
            	When an agent is associated with more than one ACD group and the switching function assigns a different agent 
            	identifier for each ACD group that the agent is associated with, then the following applies:<br></br><br></br>
            	The agent identifier shall be supplied (via the agentID parameter) on the agent state events associated with this 
            	agent (e.g., Agent Ready, Agent Not Ready).<br></br><br></br>
            	This agent identifier may or may not be part of the Device Identifier parameters (i.e., the agent identifier substring 
            	in the Switching Function Representation format) in the call control events that are associated with the 
            	agent in an ACD call. Non-ACD calls are unaffected.<br></br><br></br>
            	This agent identifier shall be part of the Device Identifier parameter (i.e., the agent identifier sub-string in the 
            	Switching Function Representation format) on services when the computing function want to focus the service 
            	at a particular ACD call or group, otherwise if not supplied, the switching function will choose which ACD call 
            	or group the service is focused.<br></br><br></br>
            	When an agent is associated with one ACD group, the switching function may or may not assign an agent identifier 
            	to the agent. If the agent identifier is not assigned, the logical element's Device Identifier of the agent device is 
            	used to represent the agent in the ACD group. If the agent identifier is assigned, then either the logical element's 
            	Device Identifier of the agent device or the agent identifier may be used to represent the agent in the ACD group. 
            	This also applies to the case where the switching function has only one agent identifier (either assigned or not) for 
            	an agent that is associated with multiple ACD groups. When only one agent identifier is assigned to an agent the 
            	following applies:<br></br><br></br>
            	The agent identifier may be supplied (via the agentID parameter) on the agent state events associated with this 
            	agent (e.g., Agent Ready, Agent Not Ready).<br></br><br></br>
            	This agent identifier may be part of the Device Identifier parameters (i.e., the agent identifier sub-string in the
            	Switching Function Representation format) in call control events that are associated with the agent in an ACD
            	call. Non-ACD calls are unaffected.<br></br><br></br>
            	This agent identifier may be supplied as part of the Device Identifier parameter (i.e., the agent identifier substring 
            	in the Switching Function Representation format) on services.<br></br><br></br>

            1. There are two possible levels of forwarding settings that can be 
            supported by a switching function. (refer to the capability exchange services for the levels supported by an 
            implementation):<br></br><br></br>
            switching function default settings - a single set of forwarding type/forwarding destination combinations 
            that can be activated/deactivated as a set.<br></br><br></br>
            user specified settings - individual forwarding type/forwarding destination combinations that can be 
            activated/deactivated one at a time.<br></br><br></br>
            2. The forwardDefault component in the forwardList indicates if information in the forwardList is the default 
            information associated with the device (in the case where the forwarding settings have never been changed, 
            for example) and what forwarding level the information is associated with. The possible values for 
            forwardDefault are:<br></br><br></br>
            defaultForwardingTypeAndForwardDN - indicates that the information is associated with the switching 
            function default settings.<br></br><br></br>

            1. The routeRegisterReqID parameter returned in the positive acknowledgement is used to identify the 
            registration over which routing requests will be sent. All routing dialogues for the routing device occur 
            over this routing registration. The routeRegisterReqID is also used when cancelling the routing registration. <br></br><br></br>
            2. The number of simultaneous registrations allowed for the same routing device is switching function 
            dependent. Some switching functions may limit this number to one, in which case only one registration per 
            routing device is allowed. When the limit is reached, subsequent route register requests for the same routing 
            device will result in negative acknowledgements from the switching function.

            This service is bi-directional (i.e., it may be invoked by the
            switching function or the routing application).<br></br><br></br>
            The routing application can use the Route End service when it cannot provide a route for a call. Typically, this can 
            occur if:<br></br><br></br>
            The routing application receives a valid routing request for a call without sufficient call information and it 
            cannot determine a routing destination.<br></br><br></br>
            The routing application has already provided all available destinations for a call and no more alternate 
            destinations are available.<br></br><br></br>
            The routing application does not have access to a database necessary to route the call.<br></br><br></br>
            In these cases, the routing application uses the Route End service to inform the server that it cannot 
            provide a route for the call in question. The Route End service request will terminate the routing dialogue 
            (routeingCrossRefID) for the call. The Route End request does not clear the call. The switching function will 
            continue to process the call using whatever default routing algorithm is available (i.e., in a switching function 
            specific way).<br></br><br></br>

            1. The contents of the primaryOldCall and the secondaryOldCall parameters may be either a "fixed view" or a 
            "local view" of the connections at a device before the conference has been completed. The switching function 
            indicates which view it provides via the connectionView parameter in the capability exchange services. <br></br><br></br>
            fixed view - for each conferenced event generated by monitors placed on different devices in a call, the 
            switching function provides the same information in the primaryOldCall and the secondaryOldCall 
            parameters independent of the monitorType (call or device-type monitor) and independent of the role of 
            the device in the conference (conferencingDevice, addedParty, etc.). The meaning of these parameters for 
            the fixed-view are:<br></br><br></br>
            primaryOldCall - specifies the first call visible at the conferencingDevice.<br></br><br></br>
            secondaryOldCall - specifies the second call visible at the conferencingDevice.<br></br><br></br>
            local view - for each conferenced event generated by monitors placed on different devices in a call, the 
            switching function provides different information in the primaryOldCall and the secondaryOldCall 
            parameters that depends upon which call was made visible first, from the perspective of the monitored 
            device. The meaning of these parameters for the local-view are: <br></br><br></br>
            primaryOldCall - specifies the first call visible at the monitored device. For example, for a devicetype 
            monitor placed on the conferencingDevice (two step conference), this is the first call placed on 
            hold (C1). For a device-type monitor placed on the addedParty device, this is the first (and only) call 
            involved in the conference (C2) from the perspective of the monitored device.<br></br><br></br>
            secondaryOldCall - specifies the second call visible at the monitored device. For example, for a 
            device-type monitor placed on the conferencingDevice (two step conference), this is the consultation 
            call (C2). For a monitor placed on the addedParty device, there is no secondaryOldCall parameter.<br></br><br></br>
            2. The conferenceConnections parameter is a list that contains the new ConnectionID and may contain the old 
            ConnectionID, the DeviceID (values such as ANI, etc.), and for externally located devices the associated 
            Network Interface DeviceID.<br></br>

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This event indicates that there may be a reduced level of event reporting and possibly no additional device 
            feedback, except connection/call clearing, provided for this device in the call due to a lack of network 
            signalling. The level of signalling provided by the network may be indicated by the networkCapability parameter.<br></br><br></br>
            Additionally, application should assume that it cannot directly manipulate the far-end device associated 
            with the Network Interface Device.<br></br><br></br>
            This event is never sent for calls made to devices that are within the switching sub-domain. This event indicates 
            that a connection with a Network Interface Device has reached the connected state, and that further events for that 
            connection refer to the state of the endpoint which the Network Interface Device is associated.<br></br><br></br>
            A common situation that generates this event includes:<br></br><br></br>
            An outgoing call has cut-through at a network interface device and further call progress information, such as

            1. The contents of the primaryOldCall and the secondaryOldCall parameters may contain either a "fixed view"
            or a "local view" of the connections at a device before the transfer has been completed. The switching
            function indicates which view it provides via the connectionView parameter in the capability exchange services. <br></br><br></br>
            fixed view - for each transferred event generated by monitors placed on different devices in a call, the
            switching function provides the same information in the primaryOldCall and the secondaryOldCall
            parameters independent of the monitorType (call or device-type monitor) and independent of the role of
            the device in the conference (conferencingDevice, addedParty, etc.). The meaning of these parameters for
            the fixed-view are:<br></br><br></br>
            primaryOldCall - specifies the first call visible at the transferringDevice.<br></br><br></br>
            secondaryOldCall - specifies the second call visible at the transferringDevice.<br></br><br></br>
            local view - for each transferred event generated by monitors placed on different devices in a call, the
            switching function provides different information in the primaryOldCall and the secondaryOldCall
            parameters that depends upon which call was made visible first, from the perspective of the monitored
            device. The meaning of these parameters for the local-view are: <br></br><br></br>
            primaryOldCall - specifies the first call visible at the monitored device. For example, for a devicetype 
            monitor placed on the transferringDevice (two step transfer), this is the first call placed on hold 
            (C1). For a device-type monitor placed on the transferredTo device, this is the first (and only) call
            involved in call C2 from the perspective of the monitored device.<br></br><br></br>
            secondaryOldCall - specifies the second call visible at the monitored device. For example, for a 
            device-type monitor placed on the transferringDevice (two step transfer), this is call C2. For a
            monitor placed on the transferredTo device, there is no secondaryOldCall parameter.
            <br></br><br></br>
            2. The transferredConnections parameter is a list that contains the new ConnectionID, old ConnectionID,
            DeviceID (values such as ANI, etc.), and for externally located devices the associated Network Interface DeviceID.

            the actual set of filtered events returned in the positive acknowledgement may include additional events to be
            filtered out (or fewer monitored events supported for the monitor) than those requested in the service request.

            Its Default value is "True".<br></br><br></br>
            It is used to deal with the following situation:<br></br><br></br>
            For windows forms controls, there are issues with directly 
            calling methods in controls from separate threads. 
            Methods that affect controls should be executed only on the thread on which the control was created. <br></br><br></br>
            Generally the ASXMLClient component will be created from the 
            same thread that other windows form controls are created, e.g. when dropping an ASXMLClient component on 
            a windows form. If some functions are invoked in ASXMLClient events to manipulate the controls, e.g. to change  
            the enabled state of a button, setting its value to "True" guarantees the function is called from the 
            same thread that the button is created, which can save the application from using "Control.Invoke" or "Control.BeginInvoke"

            <remarks>
            This DeviceID parameter type consists of two components:<br></br><br></br>
            • Device Identifier - A mandatory component that specifies the device identifier as described below. This may include one of the following:<br></br><br></br>
            A character string when using the Diallable Digits and the Switching Function Representation formats.<br></br><br></br>
            an integer value when using the Device Number format.<br></br><br></br>
            • Media Call Characteristics - An optional component that specifies the media (voice, digital data, etc.) 
            characteristics of the device. (Not supported by the ASXMLClient control)<br></br><br></br>
            <p><b>Device Identifiers Formats</b></p>
            The possible types of Device Identifiers formats are:<br></br><br></br>
            • Diallable Digits - this format is a sequence of characters to be dialled to reach a device. The sequence of 
            characters may contain diallable digits and/or special characters that specify to the switching function how 
            digits should be dialled (“,” indicates that a pause should be inserted into the dialling sequence, for example). 
            This format must be used when special dialling characters are required or when it is necessary to provide 
            partial or incomplete dialling sequences. 
            • Switching Function Representation - this format is a sequence of characters that is used to reference devices 
            within a switching sub-domain. In addition to specifying the directory number of the device, it also provides 
            the ability to specify call appearance, agent identifier, subaddress, name, etc. <br></br><br></br>
            • Device Number - this format is an non-diallable, integer representation of a Device Identifier. This format of 
            Device Identifier can be used to reference switching sub-domain devices that may not be typically associated 
            with a diallable number such as trunks, line cards, etc.<br></br><br></br>
            <p><b>Diallable Digits</b></p>
            <p><b>Generic Format: </b>DD</p>
            A first character of the Device Identifier string which is not “N” indicates that the Device Identifier uses the 
            Diallable Digits format. This format may contain from 0 (a null formatted Device Identifier) to 64 characters. DD is 
            a string of dialling commands/digits. The following is the list of the complete set of permitted dialling commands/digits and their definitions:<br></br><br></br>
            <table class="members" cellspacing="0"><tr><th>Digits</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>0-9</td><td>These characters represents the number digits on a telephone keypad.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>*</td><td>This represents the “*” character, typically found on a telephone keypad.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>#</td><td>This represents the “#” character, typically found on a telephone keypad.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>A-D</td><td>These characters represent DTMF digits.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>!</td><td>The exclamation mark indicates that a hookflash is to be inserted into the dial string.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>P</td><td>The character P followed by a string of digits indicates that the string of digits is to be pulse dialled.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>T</td><td>The character T followed by a string of digits indicates that the string of digits is to be tone dialled.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>,</td><td>The comma character indicates that dialling is to be paused. The length of the pause is provided by the switching function through the capabilities exchange services. Multiple commas can be used to create a long pause.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>W</td><td>The character W followed by a string of digits indicates that the string of digits is to be dialled only after dial tone has been detected by the switching function.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>@</td><td>The “at” symbol indicates that the switching function shall wait for “Quiet Answer” before dialling the rest of the string. This means that the switching function shall wait for remote ringing indication, followed by 5 seconds of silence.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>$</td><td>This dollar sign indicates that the switching function shall wait for the billing signal (i.e., credit card prompt tone) before continuing.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>;</td><td>The semi-colon character indicates that the digit string is incomplete and more digits will be dialled using the Dial Digits service. This character may only be used in a Diallable String Device Identifier.</td></tr>
            </table><br></br>
            <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
            In this section, the following example will be reflected. The called number is a subscriber in the US (country code 
            1) in San Jose (area code 408). The local number is 996 1010. The extension is 321. The name of the subscriber is 
            “John Smith”.<br></br><br></br>
            • If the number is called from France (country prefix 00), the string is “00,14089961010W321”.<br></br><br></br>
            • If the number is called from a switch in New York (dial 9 to get outside line), the string is “9,14089961010W321”.<br></br><br></br>
            • If the number is called from San Jose, the string is “9961010W321”.<br></br><br></br>
            • If the number is called from inside the subscriber’s PBX, the string is “321”.<br></br><br></br>

            with a diallable number such as trunks, line cards, etc.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            It is initially created by the switch and server and presented in events and service acknowledgements. The ConnectionID is always comprised of the following parameters : <br></br><br></br>
            1. CallID Octet String - An identifier used by the switching function to represent a valid call. The maximum
            length of this ID is eight octets. These IDs are created by the switching function and are globally unique
            among all calls within the switching sub-domain. <br></br><br></br>
            2. DeviceID (<see cref="T:AgileSoftware.Developer.CSTA.CSTADeviceID"/>)- An identifier which is used to represent a device in the switching sub-domain. This
            identifier can be either Static or Dynamic.<br></br><br></br>
            <p><b>Functional Requirements:</b></p>
            1. Users shall not fabricate its own Connection IDs. This will lead to unpredictable results.<br></br><br></br>
            2. The Connection IDs in events and service acknowledgements are always allocated by the switching function.<br></br><br></br>
            3. Users can extract Device IDs from Connection IDs and use them on services that have Device 
            ID parameters only if the Device ID extracted is a static Device ID that the switching function accepts. 
            Otherwise, the Device ID cannot be used.<br></br><br></br>
            4. Users shall extract Call IDs from Connection IDs, provided by the switching function, to 
            correlate event reports associated with devices that are connected together in a call.<br></br><br></br>
            5. Users will always receive an event to indicate the termination of a Connection ID if the 
            appropriate monitor is started. Refer to the individual services and events to better understand the meaning of 
            individual events with respect to connection states.<br></br><br></br>
            6. If the user issues a service with a Connection ID that cannot be controlled by the switching 
            function, the service will be rejected with a negative acknowledgement.<br></br><br></br>
            7. Connection IDs used as parameters can only have three formats:<br></br><br></br>
            a. A complete Connection ID (i.e., call ID and device ID). This extracted from either events received by the 
            computing function or positive acknowledgements received as a result of services issued.<br></br>
            When supplied as a parameter, the Connection ID will be validated by the switching function with respect 
            to the service being issued. If this Connection ID is not valid, the service request will be rejected with a 
            negative acknowledgement.<br></br><br></br>
            b. A DeviceID only Connection ID. If a service has more than one Connection ID parameter, the switching 
            function supports this type of Connection ID, and the computing function wants to use this type of 
            Connection ID, then all Connection ID parameters in the service shall be of this type.<br></br>
            If this type of Connection ID is used as the Connection ID parameter for a service, then rules documented 
            in the services sections will determine whether it is accepted or not by the switching function. If this type of 
            Connection ID is not accepted, then the service will be rejected with a negative acknowledgement. <br></br><br></br>
            c. A Call ID only Connection ID. In events, this format can only be used for the Call Cleared and Failed event. 
            If this format is used for any service other than Clear Call, Monitor Start, or Snapshot Call, it will be rejected 
            with a negative acknowledgement. <br></br><br></br>
            8. If a call changes its Call ID when a Conference or Transfer occurs, Connection IDs shall be provided to link 
            the old Call IDs to the new Call IDs. When this occurs, the event will contain a list of originally known 
            Connection IDs of devices that are still in the call along with the new replacement Connection IDs. When the 
            new Connection IDs are created in such cases, new dynamic Device IDs may also be used to create the 
            Connection IDs. <br></br><br></br>
            9. Connection IDs that come from the switching function (events and positive acknowledgements to services) 
            will always contain both the Call ID and Device ID portions (see item 7a above) except for the Call Cleared 
            and Failed events that may also contain only a valid call ID in the connection ID (see item 7c above). <br></br><br></br>
            10. The computing function should never assume the reuse of callIDs, although some switching functions may 
            reuse one or the other.<br></br><br></br>

            It allows the application to send code/digits (ASCII string with 0-9,*, and # only) with the routed call. These code/digits are treated 
            as dial-ahead digits for the call, and are stored in the adial-ahead buffer.<br></br>
            They can be collected (one at a time or in a group) using the collect digits vector command(s) on the switch.<br></br>
            "UP_NONE" means no digits provided with this call.<br></br>
            The "#" character terminates the G3 PBX user collection of user input so it is the last character present in the string if it is sent.

            <remarks>
            A state that an agent may take in relation to an ACD device or ACD group and the calls associated with the ACD 
            device or ACD group.<br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Null - The state where an agent is not logged-on to (i.e., logged off from) the ACD device or ACD group 
            at a particular device. Logging-on and logging-off from an ACD device or ACD group shall cause the 
            transitions from and to this state. The event report that represents the entry to this state is the Agent Logged Off 
            event. Note that the presence/absence of the ACD Group parameter in this event determines if the agent has 
            logged off of an ACD device or an ACD group.<br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Logged On - The state where an agent is logged-on at a particular device to an ACD device or ACD 
            group and is ready to contribute to the activities of the ACD device or ACD group. This state does not indicate 
            that the agent is ready to accept ACD calls (refer to the Agent Ready event section). The event report that 
            represents the entry to this state is the Agent Logged On event. Note that the presence/absence of the ACD 
            Group parameter in this event determines if the agent has logged on to an ACD device or an ACD group.<br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Not Ready - The state where an agent is logged-on at a particular device to an ACD device or ACD 
            group but is not prepared to handle calls that the ACD distributes. While in this state an agent may receive calls 
            that are not ACD calls. The event report that represents the entry to this state is the Agent Not Ready event.<br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Ready - The state where an agent is logged-on at a particular device to an ACD device or ACD group 
            and is prepared to handle ACD calls even though it may be involved with non-ACD calls. The event report that 
            represents the entry to this state is the Agent Ready event.<br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Busy - The state where an agent is involved with an existing ACD call at the device, even if that call is 
            on hold at that device. Calls between agents, calls between supervisors and agents and private calls may or may 
            not cause this transition. The event report that represents the entry to this state is the Agent Busy event.<br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Working After Call - The state where an agent is no longer connected to an ACD call but is still occupied 
            with work related to a previous ACD call. In this state, an agent cannot receive ACD calls but may be able to 
            receive non-ACD calls. The agent may be performing administrative duties (e.g., updating a business order 
            form) for a previous call, or may be involved with a non-ACD call. The event report that represents the entry to 
            this state is the Agent Working After Call event.<br></br><br></br>

            <remarks>
            The following are the types of conditions that would trigger the redirection, or forwarding of the
            incoming call:<br></br><br></br>
            1. Immediate - This condition indicates that if a call arrives at a device, it is immediately redirected to another	device.<br></br><br></br>
            2. Busy - This condition indicates that if a call arrives at a device, and the device is busy with another call, then
            the incoming call will be redirected to another device.<br></br><br></br>
            3. No Answer - This condition indicates that if a call arrives at a device, and the call is not answered within a
            certain number of rings or within a specific amount of time, then the incoming call will be redirected to
            another device.<br></br><br></br>
            4. Do Not Disturb (DND) - This condition indicates that if a call arrives at a device, and the device has the Do
            Not Disturb feature active at the device, then the incoming call will be redirected to another device. Note that
            the Do Not Disturb feature does not necessarily imply that incoming calls are forwarded.<br></br><br></br>
            5. Type of Call Origination - This condition indicates that if a call arrives at a device, and the originating device
            is a specific class (i.e., external, such as a device that is outside the switching sub-domain, or internal, such as
            a device that is within the switching sub-domain), then the incoming call will be redirected to another device.
            This condition can be used in combination with the others to create a compound condition. For example, if
            busy with another call and the calling device is outside the switching sub-domain, then redirect the call to
            another device.<br></br><br></br>

            The difference between it and the <see cref="T:AgileSoftware.Developer.CSTA.enAgentState"/> is that it does not include the "agentBusy" item. <br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Null - The state where an agent is not logged-on to (i.e., logged off from) the ACD device or ACD group 
            at a particular device. Logging-on and logging-off from an ACD device or ACD group shall cause the 
            transitions from and to this state. The event report that represents the entry to this state is the Agent Logged Off 
            event. Note that the presence/absence of the ACD Group parameter in this event determines if the agent has 
            logged off of an ACD device or an ACD group.<br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Logged On - The state where an agent is logged-on at a particular device to an ACD device or ACD 
            group and is ready to contribute to the activities of the ACD device or ACD group. This state does not indicate 
            that the agent is ready to accept ACD calls (refer to the Agent Ready event section). The event report that 
            represents the entry to this state is the Agent Logged On event. Note that the presence/absence of the ACD 
            Group parameter in this event determines if the agent has logged on to an ACD device or an ACD group.<br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Not Ready - The state where an agent is logged-on at a particular device to an ACD device or ACD 
            group but is not prepared to handle calls that the ACD distributes. While in this state an agent may receive calls 
            that are not ACD calls. The event report that represents the entry to this state is the Agent Not Ready event.<br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Ready - The state where an agent is logged-on at a particular device to an ACD device or ACD group 
            and is prepared to handle ACD calls even though it may be involved with non-ACD calls. The event report that 
            represents the entry to this state is the Agent Ready event.<br></br><br></br>
            • Agent Working After Call - The state where an agent is no longer connected to an ACD call but is still occupied 
            with work related to a previous ACD call. In this state, an agent cannot receive ACD calls but may be able to 
            receive non-ACD calls. The agent may be performing administrative duties (e.g., updating a business order 
            form) for a previous call, or may be involved with a non-ACD call. The event report that represents the entry to 
            this state is the Agent Working After Call event.<br></br><br></br>
